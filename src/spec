Got rid of player bc it is rts style. Need clicking functionality for selecting units.

Remember it was originally supposed to be a kind of tower defense game. Maybe I should go back to that.

blocks need to be instantiated more dynamically like bullets

zombies need to move towards the tower...
more zombies need to be made, randomly,
zombie direction needs to setable. means that u pass direction data through uniform to zombie shader

Anyway, for what it is now...
) Make beginning area have borders on all sides.
) Maybe make monster be able to jump.
) Maybe put monster in 2nd area.
) Maybe have a flashing arrow pointing right like they would in something like turtles in time
) More monsters?
) Bullets actually hurt monster and you can kill him?
) Add sounds?
) Add music?
